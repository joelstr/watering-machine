# Watering code

Arduino code running on an M5Stack Core2 measuring the moist in the plant soil.


## TODO
* Change broker address when static IP in place
* Publish actual moist level instead of dummy values
* Also publish if watering is required or not
* Add possibility to have more plants
* Control pump (automatically?)
